# gamebuino wasm emulator distribution files
Distribution files for the [gamebuino wasm emulator version](https://github.com/aoneill01/wasm-gamebuino) by @aoneill01 (based on unpkg 0.70 version) that allows scaling the console or add fullscreen view.
These distribution files are based on the distribution files i added for the old emulator (that has no sound). 
They are based on the build package from unpkg but i did not see an easy way to add this to the original repo as the files i modify are part of
the package. Maybe someone can incorporte them some other way but i think it's beyond the scope of the initial project.

Basically i added `?bin=` parameter support again and added scale to fit options for scaling the emulator to fit the browser screen. It can
be handy if you release on itch.io or want people to be able to play the games on a phone. I also added a version with a new skin for the console.
